# Tyrus: A High-Fidelity TypeScript-to-Rust Compiler

_Academic Project in Compiler Theory & Semantic Preservation_

Tyrus is a source-to-source compiler designed to bridge the gap between high-level dynamic syntax (TypeScript) and low-level memory safety (Rust). As an academic initiative, it focuses on the formal mapping of higher-order abstractions to zero-cost Rust equivalents, exploring the boundaries of **Semantic Preservation** across differing execution models.

## 🔬 Core Philosophies

### 🛡️ Zero Magic

Tyrus does not rely on a hidden runtime or garbage collection emulation. Every TypeScript construct is mapped to its most efficient Rust equivalent, leveraging Rust's ownership model and strict type system at compile time.

### 📐 Semantic Preservation

The primary goal is formal equivalence. If a TypeScript project is "Oxidizable," the generated Rust code is guaranteed to maintain the original logic's semantic integrity while improving performance and security.

### 🚫 The Oxidizable Standard

Tyrus enforces a strict subset of TypeScript called the "Oxidizable Standard." It rejects non-idiomatic or unsafe patterns (like `any` or `eval`) to ensure the resulting Rust code is both safe and performant.

## 🚀 Feature Tiers

### Tier 1: Core Language (Production Ready)

- Primitives (`string`, `number`, `boolean`)
- Control Flow (`if/else`, `while`, `for`)
- Error Handling (`Result`, `Option`)

### Tier 2: Advanced Type System (Production Ready)

- Interfaces and Type Aliases to Structs/Enums
- Generics and Polymorphism
- Comprehensive Collection Mapping (`Array<T>` -> `Vec<T>`)

### Tier 3: Ecosystem & Asynchony (Production Ready)

- `Async/Await` to Future-based concurrency
- JSON Serialization/Deserialization (via `serde`)
- HTTP Client and REST patterns (via `axum` & `reqwest`)

### 📦 Supported Patterns (Verified)

- **Array Literals**: `[1, 2, 3]` -> `vec![1, 2, 3]`
- **Computed Properties**: `obj["key"]` -> `obj["key"]` (via serde_json)
- **Class State**: Automatic `Arc<Mutex<T>>` wrapping for services/controllers.
- **DTOs**: Pure structs for data transfer objects.
- **Standard Lib**: `map`, `filter`, `find`, `push` mapped to Rust equivalents.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (Stable)
- Cargo

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gefferson-Souza/Tyrus.git
cd Tyrus
cargo build --release
```

### Compiling a Project

```bash
# Analyze a TypeScript file for compatibility
./target/release/tyrus check ./src/index.ts

# Transpile to a complete Rust project
./target/release/tyrus build ./src/index.ts
```
